        <p id="my-paragraph">Java Script and its relationship to HTML and CSS</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">Video editor creating a video with effects and animation</p>
        <p id="my-paragraph">HTML</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">HTML would be the video clips themselves before effects or animation get added to them. they provide structure and content of the video</p>
        <div class="center-image">
          <img src="..\img\videoclips.png" alt="my own image">
        </div> 

        <p id="my-paragraph">CSS</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">CSS would be the effects you add on to the video clips such as colors adjust brightness and filter effects</p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="..\img\effects.png" alt="my own image">
      </div> 

        <p id="my-paragraph">Before adding effects</p>
      <div class="center-image">       
        <img src="..\img\original.png" alt="my own image">
      </div>

        <p id="my-paragraph">After adding effects</p>
      <div class="center-image">       
        <img src="..\img\negative.png" alt="my own image">
      </div>

       <p id="my-paragraph">JavaScript</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">JavaScript would be the animations you add on to the video clips e.g., you can add animated tranisitions, text overlays or interactive buttons but for this example
        we are going to use text overlays
       </p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="..\img\animation.png" alt="my own image">
      </div>     
       
       <p id="my-paragraph">Text overlay animation</p>       
    
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="..\img\textoverlay.png" alt="my own image">
      </div>     

       <p class="paragraph2">the text overlay in the image (clip) transitions from top to bottom with a wave animation starting from left of the text to the right of the text
        while the bottom text does a fade in clockwise swivel animation</p>
      
  <h2 class="post-title">Control flow and Loops</h2>
       <p class="paragraph2">Control flow is like a path or sequential instructions that are used in programming. Loops is a type of coding that uses repitition on given instructions</p>

       <p id="my-paragraph">Control flow Analogy for Creating a music Playlist</p>
       <p id="my-paragraph">Step 1:</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">In order to listen to music you first have to download a music software program</p>
       <p id="my-paragraph">Step 2:</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">Once you have downloaded a music app Create a playlist</p>
       <p id="my-paragraph">Step 3:</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">Start browsing or searching for music to add to your playlist</p>
       <p id="my-paragraph">Step 4:</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">Once you have added your music to the playlist you can now listen to the music you have added</p>
       
       <p id="my-paragraph">Loops</p>
       <p class="paragraph2">When listening to music a example for loops would be selecting the first song on your playlist, repeating your playlist e.g., when you get to the last song of your playlist it will go back to the first song on your list 
        and will loop through repeatedly as long as the repeat all function is active or just having one song on repeat and will just continuously play that one song for as long as the repeat 1 function is active.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Document Object Model layout example</h2>
      <p class="paragraph2">Understanding what Document Object Model (DOM) is we can think of it like a family tree ranging from various levels starting from your ancestors being at the top and sequentialy 
        going through the branch all the way down to its descendants

      <p id="my-paragraph">Basic DOM interactions</p>
      <p class="paragraph2">if we open up the Chrome Developer tools console we can type <code>document.</code>this will list properties, methods and objects regarding the children of the <code>document</code>object</p>

        <img src="..\img\console.png" alt="my own image" id="border-image">

      <p id="my-paragraph">Basic expression example</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">Input:<code>1</code></p>
        <p class="paragraph2">Output: when executing the above command it is going to return the output of<code>1</code></p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="..\img\input1.png" alt="my own image" id="border-image">
      </div> 

      <p id="my-paragraph">adding</p>
      <p class="paragraph2">Input:<code>1+4</code></p>
      <p class="paragraph2">Output: when executing the above command, it is going to return an output of<code>5</code></p>
    <div class="center-image">

    <p id="my-paragraph">$ command</p>
    <p class="paragraph2">Input:<code>$_</code></p>
    <p class="paragraph2">Output: when executing the above command, it is going to return an output of the last expression e.g.,<code>5</code></p>
  <div class="center-image">

  </div> 

  <h2 class="post-title">Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
    <p id="my-paragraph">Array</p>
    <p class="paragraph2">You could think of an array as the amount of CDs you have with its own number e.g. what order its in within the stack counting the top of the stack as one second from top as two and so on. you can 
      ask to listen to specific cds within the stack for example: if someone wanted to listen to number 6 or 11 from the stack. from this example this is how you would collect data for arrays.
    </p>
    <div class="center-image">
      <img src="..\img\array.png" alt="my own image">
    </div> 

    <p id="my-paragraph">Object</p>
    <p class="paragraph2">objects are like a list of songs within the cds but instead of using numbers like the cds within the stack you would use the name of the song e.g. you would ask what the title of the song is you would get a reply
      from someone that knows the name of the song and this is how i would think about gaining data from an object point of view
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-title">What functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p id="my-paragraph">Function</p>
    <p class="paragraph2">functions make complex tasks simple and make them easier to manage they could also make troubleshoot issues easy to manage aswell. they allow you to break down your
      code into smaller units. so for a music example think about your playlist that has your favourite songs on it we would be able to create a function which will play a song from your playlist
    </p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Summary</h2>
    <p class="paragraph2">Overall, document provides various JavaScript Fundamentals, using analogies and examples explaining concepts in regards to HTML, CSS, control flow, loops, the DOM, accessing data, and functions</p>
