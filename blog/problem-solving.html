          <p id="my-paragraph">Being blocked on a simple problem & elegantly solved a problem</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            When working on the Fizzbuzz task it required divisible equations by certain numbers, e.g. numbers that were divisble by 15, 5, and 3 and would return strings and if its not 
            divisible by either 15, 3, or 5 it returns the original number. I understood the question i was just struggling with what sort of approach i was going to do in terms of
            how i was going to write the code out and the more i was flicking through the js and test js file the more i was getting confused. so the first thing i did was research 
            for the basics of divisible equation coding (JavaScript). throughout the research i stumbled accross one video that sort of had the exact same approach as the question i was 
            stuck with. what intrigued me about the video was that he talks about the answers being in the questions and if your dealing with files for problem solving the answers 
            are in there also. that gave me some sort of an understanding about what i thought was a question that lacked clarity in relations to kata. 
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">Problem solving techniques used</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            After hours of research there were a few problem solving techniques i applied the first one was simple it was the same approach i been doing from past task which was a 
            straight foward approach by writing the following in my notebook. first step was to see if the number was divisible by 3 and 5, e.g. 15 and if it was return string FizzBuzz
            second step was checking to see if number is divisible by 3 if so return the string Fizz. third step was check to see if number was divisible by 5 if so return string Buzz
            after writing these down in my notes i had come to a conclusion for my next problem solving technique which was how i was going to write this in code and just from looking 
            i could sort of see that it would have the use of variables but not to store values but rather evaluates the conditions and returns a string in relations to the divisibility
            of the input number, conditional statements such as ifs and else ifs, and comparison operators.
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">How did you feel throughout the process</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            Im the sort of person where if nothing sinks in i have to write it in my own words on pen and paper which gives some sort of clarity wether if its code or trying to understand 
            a question its something where if im writing on pen or paper i somewhat have to repeat that process if a similar question or something im not familiar with pops up. 
            so in that sense i feel comfortable to an extend until a familiar problem like that arrises again.
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">What i learnt</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            In general, although this is still all new to me i feel i have gained abit of basic knowledge of reading the code basics such as if i see functions variables
            loops etc. written in code i can read and understand what it means where as before i had no idea what was going on, a little understanding that you can use different types 
            of methods to your code that minimizes your code and makes it more tidy and for the Fizzbuzz task i learnt that with variables also play a crucial role in data manipulation
            state management and control flow rather than simple value storage. as mentioned before im still new to JavaScript and am satisfied with what ive learnt so far and looking
            foward to gain more knowledge with JavaScript.

                I usually give myself a time limit first without asking for help e.g., if im stuck on something i give myself a time limit for example a hour if im still stuck within that
                hour then i will ask for help and another time i would ask for help is when deadline is really close. i only try ask for help in those situations as i try not to fully 
                compromise my learning when it comes to asking for help.

                  i dont feel uncomfortable or anything when it comes to help so if i need to ask coaches for help i would ask and to me any question is a good question regadless of what level of 
                  question you are asking.

                Improving Process with reflections is important specially when you start getting a more understanding with coding it helps build confidence specially when solving problems
                with coding and reflecting helps me evaluate my approach with areas for improvement and adjust my skills.

          <p id="my-paragraph">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</p>
            
          <p class="paragraph2">
            As mentioned above my mind is set on giving myself a time limit and if i dont complete a question in the required time i had set myself i would ask for help. being hesitant
            about asking for help would just stress you out more on what you are trying to accomplish. as long as it doesnt compromise your learning too much and you understand the 
            answer you were given.
