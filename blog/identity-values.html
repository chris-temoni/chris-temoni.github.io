          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision

          So my last course i was doing, personal growth and progressive learning was crucial and what i noticed 
          as i progreesed through to a month of the course is that it would require putting in serious effort before asking for help. it would help me gain
          problem solving skills in a timely manner and at the same time
          overcome certain challenges without fully compromising each course related task(s)
          overall i felt satisfied with the decisions i made as it helped me grow as a
          learner

          The vibe within the eit environment was really serious but at the same time,
          motivating, and inspiring ive learnt alot from not only lecturers 
          but my peers within my class which helped guide my actions
          towards different tasks and challenges within the course. i was
          grateful for the space i was in regarding and the feedback
          that had influenced me for who i am today in terms of learning and
          interactions with others

        <p class="paragraph2">
          i feel confident asking for help or asisstance when i needed it and
          understanding the basic concepts of tasks that were given to us. it gave me a
          strong foundation for my learning journey the tasks that we were undertaking, hugely
          encouraged me to confidentaly engage with the resources that were given to us at the time
          and collaborate with others to overcome challenges and achieving
          success with the concepts and skills related to my past course.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          limitations for me was time managment, technical skills, and
          building confidence but even though they were present i seen them as
          opportunities for development. i will prioritise these limitations that i have by
          navigating my journey effectively in order to achive my goals

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          During my studies at eit there were some situations where there was tension amongst my peers especially when it got close to deadlines of completing tasks
          in those situations i would try open communication and progressively build
          trust within my peers and the situation. i feel resistance and tension could be addressed in that manner
          no matter how high the situation is building trust within
          my eit peers and lecturers lead to communication improvement and
          working together
