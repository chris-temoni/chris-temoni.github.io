          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          personal growth and learning requirements for sprint-1 was crucial by
          putting in serious effort before asking for help. it helped gain
          problem solving skills in a timely manner and at the same time
          overcome certain challenges without fully compromising each challenge
          i feel satisfied with the decisions i made as it helped me grow as a
          learner
        </p>

        <p id="my-paragraph">
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          The vibe within the devacademy community is really positive,
          motivating, and inspiring ive learnt alot from not only facilitators
          but the students and my cohort group which helped guide my actions
          towards different tasks and challenges within this sprint i am
          grateful for the space im in regarding this course and the feedback
          that has influenced me for who i am today in terms of learning and
          interactions with others
        </p>

        <p id="my-paragraph">
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          i feel confident asking for help or asisstance when i need it and
          understanding the basic concepts of the tasks completed. it gave me a
          strong foundation for my learning journey the task taken hugely
          encouraged me to confidentaly engage with upcoming learning materials
          and collaborate with others to overcome challenges and achieving
          success with the concepts and skills related to this course
        </p>

        <p id="my-paragraph">
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          limitations for me would be time managment, technical skills, and
          building confidence but even though they are present i see them as
          opportunities for development. i will prioritise these limitations by
          navigating my journey effectively in order to achive my goals
        </p>

        <p id="my-paragraph">
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph2">
          there wasnt really any resistance or tension during the sprint if
          there were i would try open communication and progressively build
          trust i feel resistance and tension could be addressed in that manner
          no matter how high the situation is building trust within the
          devacademy community will lead to communication improvement and
          working together
