          <p id="my-paragraph">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            I have gained a deeper understanding of myself throughout the core learning which has helped me make crucial decisions and prioritise my actions. recognizing and managing 
            my emotions more, has aslo allowed me to recognize that my emotions at times has had an impact on my actions and thoughts, it helped me recognize that 
            how it could affect others. reconizing these behaviours allowed me to build more trust and relationships with others specially in challenging situations 
            with self-awareness and empathy towards myself and others.thoughout the core learnings i now understand that my skill set and abillities are not firm
            but i also know that they can develop and improve overtime through sheer effort and dedication. one thing ive learnt was not to compare myself to others but myself 
            and how far ive improved on a weekly basis. this mindset has encouraged me to embrace challenges and see struggles and failures as a opportunity for growth in my learning.
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            These roles for learning and programming are important it helped me make ethical decisions and understand the importance of my actions. 
            empathy helps with understanding different perspectives of others aswell as their needs. A good example would be collaborations, looping and listerning. 
            self-awareness as a programmer, ive learnt that recognizing my own strengths, and weaknesses enabled me to recognize personal growth and effective problem-solving   
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            The thing about core learning that stood out the most for me is that my mindset and attitude play a huge role specially when it comes to my ability to absorb new information
            and develope new skills. putting these core skills into practice that helped me was the way i think now it has opened me up to approach learning with a positive
            and curious mindset rather than seeing learnig as a serious requirement that just needed to be done. i am proud at how far i have come and the progress i have made by
            implementing these values with not only for this course but in everyday life. 
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was staying focused on parts that required alot of reading as much as i wanted to skip through most of the reading
            i instead read one page at a time and took breaks in between which helped alot in that area. 
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            I think its to better understand ourselves in the context of others. and utilising our core skills will set us up for bootcamp and our career in the tech industry. 
            through a careers perspective i feel employers are not only looking for good programmmers but also the values and importance of well being and mindfulness you hold within
            yourself, and someone that will also enhance the culture of their team 
          </p>

          <p id="my-paragraph">
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? 
            Justify your answer.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph2">
            Although i need alot of practise in programming i also feel now that it is also important to study core learning aswell, as it introduces you to techniques that train
            the mind and other helpful ways of understanding problems, it also strengthens self-solving skills throughout your core learning practice 
          </p>
