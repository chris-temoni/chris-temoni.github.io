      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        i have natural curiosity and willingness to learn new things when it comes to IT i enjoy problem solving critical thinking and diving deep into IT related subjects.
        my limitations is that im impatient at times when it comes to learning specially when i have alot to do when it comes to almost reaching deadlines i tend to seek quick results
        and ask for answers rather than trying to solve them when i feel i wont complete the required task(s) throughout my studies ive noticed that theres is always going to be a situation where your not going to complete 
        task(s) within a required deadline in a way how you want your project or tasks requirement results would look thats what makes me love IT in general theres always that pressure 
        and tight deadline requirements. 

      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">

        i will actively communicate with others when needed, treat everyone did i work with respect regardless of there experience 
        prioritise my tasks when faced with challenges or tension i will approach the situation with a solution-orientated mindset 
        i would try recognize stress or pressure may build during the course i would take breaks or seek support in regrads to what im 
        having trouble with when it comes to task requirements and actively reflect on my progress with the course
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        if i was stuck on a task i would set myself a time limit e.g., an hour if i dont solve that problem within an hour 
        i would reach out for help. i would try to solve the problem myself to an extent if i was stuck on a project or a task

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        The facilitators have an important role and at times quite busy when help is needed but that is expected
        but i would expect gaining knowledge with there expertise, a timely mannered response when needed, 
        learning alot and improving personally from the facilitators knowledge and understanding when undergoing this course  
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        at the moment im doing another course which is quite time demanding but i accomodate This
        commitment by scheduling my time with devacademy in a timely manner its a struggle to keep 
        up with both courses but my approach to this situation allows me to priotize these commitments
        in a tight but managable manner
