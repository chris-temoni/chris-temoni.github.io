      <p id="my-paragraph">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
         My long term goal is to still become an IT manager with various IT related skills and learning full-stack web developement will help immensely towards achieving my goal
         so what im hoping to use these skills ive gained during the course, and the impact i would like to make once i leave dev academy is contributing to projects by collaborating
         with teams, solving problems and creating solutions relating to programming and web developement. 
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        I have not discovered new tendencies during fondations instead i have recognized the importance to address my limitations. i have discovered that recognizing these tendencies
        can help me develop stratergies to overcome these flaws, by embracing a growth mindset, motivation and dedicating time for independent problem-solving. this will be crucial in 
        order to succeed in bootcamp
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        My biggest non-technical challenge i would think would be during Bootcamp is trying to stay focused and motivated thourghout the program i feel it could require perseverance and 
        discipline to consitently keep up with material, collaborating in group projects might also be a challenge to overcome during bootcamp
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        My goal would be, to become more capable and versatile, by improving my skills to collaborate and work effectively with others during bootcamp, by contributing to team projects,
        and do my best while working with others. communication skills will be a huge factor when working with others, it will allow me to express my thoughts clearly, and 
        respectively listen to others.
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        My expectations from the bootcamp team would be asiistance, guidance, and a supportive environment throughout the journey. and during these expectations i be able to gain 
        further knowledge and also a space where ill feel motivated, valued, and encouraged to reach my full potential during this journey.
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        I tend to have high expectations for myself, so i would expect myself to be dedicated and fully commited to my learning journey. i will utilize various resources available to me
        which includes reaching out for help, taking in all the required information such as documentation, online research, and tutorials etc. i will also take in to consideration that
        collaborating with others, engaging in group study sessions, communicate openly and respectfully listen to my peers and after hour sessions where we can support and learn 
        from each other and most importantly gain their trust. i will commit myself to practicing my time management skills and also setting myself weekly goals. i will fully 
        utilize the skills we have learnt from this course by implementing my core values before and after each study session to help stay focused and motivated. overall my approach to
        bootcamp will be to have a positive mindset and maintaining that mindset, take full responsibility for my learning, seek help when i need it, and try impose a collaborative and
        respectfull environment to boost myself and others learning experience.

         A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        i have natural curiosity and willingness to learn new things when it comes to IT i enjoy problem solving critical thinking and diving deep into IT related subjects.
        my limitations is that im impatient at times when it comes to learning specially when i have alot to do when it comes to almost reaching deadlines i tend to seek quick results
        and ask for answers rather than trying to solve them when i feel i wont complete the required task(s) throughout my studies ive noticed that theres is always going to be a situation where your not going to complete 
        task(s) within a required deadline in a way how you want your project or tasks requirement results would look thats what makes me love IT in general theres always that pressure 
        and tight deadline requirements. 
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">

        adapt in a fast-paced environment collaborate with others manage my time efficiently and effectively when it comes to meeting task requirements and being inspired and motivated by others 
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        i will actively communicate with others when needed, treat everyone did i work with respect regardless of there experience 
        prioritise my tasks when faced with challenges or tension i will approach the situation with a solution-orientated mindset 
        i would try recognize stress or pressure may build during the course i would take breaks or seek support in regrads to what im 
        having trouble with when it comes to task requirements and actively reflect on my progress with the course
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        if i was stuck on a task i would set myself a time limit e.g., an hour if i dont solve that problem within an hour 
        i would reach out for help. i would try to solve the problem myself to an extent if i was stuck on a project or a task 
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        The facilitators have an important role and at times quite busy when help is needed but that is expected
        but i would expect gaining knowledge with there expertise, a timely mannered response when needed, 
        learning alot and improving personally from the facilitators knowledge and understanding when undergoing this course  
      </p>

      <p id="my-paragraph">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.      </p>

      <p class="paragraph2">
        at the moment im doing another course which is quite time demanding but i accomodate This
        commitment by scheduling my time with devacademy in a timely manner its a struggle to keep 
        up with both courses but my approach to this situation allows me to priotize these commitments
        in a tight but managable manner
